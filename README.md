# Dribbble
## The send email function by resend is not working as I can send test emails to only my own email id.
This is a Full stack MERN web app I designed where the user can register by filling up a registration form. On the next page, the user can select a default profile picture from a set or upload his or her own photo which will be saved on the cloud using cloudinary's image api. All the data gets stored in an online MongoDB cluster. For DB connectivity I have used Mongoose.
